Open up your infrastructure's construction plans for better contributions
===

"We are all contributors and developers."

From this simple statement I would like to demonstrate how infrastructure changes can receive commits in the same way that development teams deliver software. In a continuous workflow, which allows better communication, more reviews, more automatic testing and overall better collaboration.

This presentation will expose a real world workflow used daily at Trainline to make our infrastructure changes happen fast and with confidence. These changes are often distributed over several teams: networking, security, platform reliability and developers but can be delivered quickly thanks to improved collaboration and a set of good tools (Terraform, Vault) orchestrated by our automated build system (Gitlab-CI).

Let's bring mature (but adaptable) workflows and distribute knowledge within our teams, it can only be beneficial for each individual and for your project.
