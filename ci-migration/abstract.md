# A smooth migration to Docker by focusing on your build pipelines 

Should you directly go full-docker everywhere? We hear a lot of "Docker all the things" nowadays. It's usually a good idea to start using containers but pushing your entire production in docker might by too much to start with.

This talk will present our use case at Trainline where we migrated our entire build infrastructure to Docker going from servers lying on the floor - when we were still Captain Train - to AWS today. 

We will be going from the reasons we needed to migrate to the solutions we use now. Describing also the difficulties we faced during the journey. Hope you will enjoy the ride!
